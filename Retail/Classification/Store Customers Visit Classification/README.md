# Classify consumer trips to the Store

LeKart - machine learning classification with python


LeKart uses both art and science to continually make progress on their core mission of better understanding and serving their customers. One way LeKart is able to improve customers' shopping experiences is by segmenting their store visits into different trip types. 

Whether they're on a last minute run for new puppy supplies or leisurely making their way through a weekly grocery list, classifying trip types enables LeKart to create the best shopping experience for every customer.

Currently, LeKart's trip types are created from a combination of existing customer insights ("art") and purchase history data ("science"). Classify customer trips using only a transactional dataset of the items they've purchased. Improving the science behind trip type classification will help LeKart refine their segmentation process.
