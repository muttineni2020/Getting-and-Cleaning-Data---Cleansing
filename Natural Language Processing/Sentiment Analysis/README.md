## Sentiment Analysis

I have created multiple Jupyter Notebooks and use a number of data science libraries along the way. 

	+ our goal is to look at transcripts of various comedians and note their similarities and differences.  

	+ Specifically, I'd like to know if Ali Wong's comedy style is different than other comedians, since she's the comedian that got me interested in stand up comedy.  

Data set i have considered modelling is from "http://scrapsfromtheloft.com/"

### Instructions  

The easiest way to get started is to download Anaconda, which is free and open source.  
When you download this, it comes with the Jupyter  Notebook IDE and many popular data science libraries, so you don’t have to install them one by one.  

Here are the steps you’ll need to take before the start of the tutorial:  

### 1. Download Anaconda  
I highly recommend that you download [the Python 3.7 version](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  

### 2. Download the Jupyter Notebooks  
Clone or download this repo, so you have access to all the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb extension) in the tutorial.
