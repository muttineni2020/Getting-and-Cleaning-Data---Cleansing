    "In effect, we are are moving complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity exists in the relationships between the input and output data. In the case of time series, there is no concept of input and output variables; we must invent these too and frame the supervised learning problem from scratch.\n",

    "We may lean on the capability of sophisticated models to decipher the complexity of the problem. We can make the job for these models easier (and even use simpler models) if we can better expose the inherent relationship between inputs and outputs in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty is that we do not know the underlying inherent functional relationship between inputs and outputs that we’re trying to expose. If we did know, we probably would not need machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the only feedback we have is the performance of models developed on the supervised learning datasets or “views” of the problem we create. In effect, the best default strategy is to use all the knowledge available to create many good datasets from your time series dataset and use model performance (and other project requirements) to help determine what good features and good views of your problem happen to be.\n",
    "\n",
