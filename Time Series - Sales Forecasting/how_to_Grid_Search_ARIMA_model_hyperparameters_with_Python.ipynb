    "### 1. Evaluate ARIMA Model\n",
    "We can evaluate an ARIMA model by preparing it on a training dataset and evaluating predictions on a test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the dataset into training and test sets.\n",
    "2. Walk the time steps in the test dataset: (1) Train an ARIMA model, (2) Make a one-step prediction, (3) Store prediction; get and store actual observation.\n",
    "3. Calculate error score for predictions compared to expected values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement this in Python as a new standalone function called evaluate_arima_model() that takes a time series dataset as input as well as a tuple with the p, d, and q parameters for the model to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split in two: 66% for the initial training dataset and the remaining 34% for the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time step of the test set is iterated. Just one iteration provides a model that you could use to make predictions on new data. The iterative approach allows a new ARIMA model to be trained each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prediction is made each iteration and stored in a list. This is so that at the end of the test set, all predictions can be compared to the list of expected values and an error score calculated. In this case, a mean squared error score is calculated and returned.\n",

    "Evaluating a suite of parameters is relatively straightforward.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two additional considerations. The first is to ensure the input data are floating point values (as opposed to integers or strings), as this can cause the ARIMA procedure to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the statsmodels ARIMA procedure internally uses numerical optimization procedures to find a set of coefficients for the model. These procedures can fail, which in turn can throw an exception. We must catch these exceptions and skip those configurations that cause a problem. This happens more often then you would think.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Seed Grid**. The classical diagnostic tools of ACF and PACF plots can still be used with the results used to seed the grid of ARIMA parameters to search.\n",
    "* **Alternate Measures**. The search seeks to optimize the out-of-sample mean squared error. This could be changed to another out-of-sample statistic, an in-sample statistic, such as AIC or BIC, or some combination of the two. You can choose a metric that is most meaningful on your project.\n",
    "* **Residual Diagnostics**. Statistics can automatically be calculated on the residual forecast errors to provide an additional indication of the quality of the fit. Examples include statistical tests for whether the distribution of residuals is Gaussian and whether there is an autocorrelation in the residuals.\n",
    "* **Update Model**. The ARIMA model is created from scratch for each one-step forecast. With careful inspection of the API, it may be possible to update the internal data of the model with new observations rather than recreating it from scratch.\n",
    "* **Preconditions**. The ARIMA model can make assumptions about the time series dataset, such as normality and stationarity. These could be checked and a warning raised for a given of a dataset prior to a given model being trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this tutorial, you discovered how to grid search the hyperparameters for the ARIMA model in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A procedure that you can use to grid search ARIMA hyperparameters for a one-step rolling forecast.\n",
    "* How to apply ARIMA hyperparameters tuning on standard univariate time series datasets.\n",
    "* Ideas on how to further improve grid searching of ARIMA hyperparameters."
